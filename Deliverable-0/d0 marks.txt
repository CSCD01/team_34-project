Comments: Team goals are not ambitious and does not explain how team background will help achieve said goals. Multiple team member introductions fall short of the minimum 150 word requirement. Inconsistent formatting between team member introductions and reads as if it was put together from different paragraphs by different authors. A few grammatical errors in team member introductions. Font suddenly changes near the end of team agreement.
